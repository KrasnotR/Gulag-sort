# Gulag-sort

Various implementations of the gulag sort

## What is the Gulag-sort?

1. Get the first list and go trough each element, if the current element is bigger than the previous one, write it into the current list. If the current element is smaller than the previous one, switch to a new list and write the current number into that list.

2. Sort all lists by their average and add them back into one single list.

3. Go back to step 1 (one) until the list is sorted.

### yes i know the current implementation is fucking broken
